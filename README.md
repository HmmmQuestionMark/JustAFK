**JustAFK** brings a simple - yet powerful - AFK (away from keyboard) plugin to Bukkit servers.


Installation
============

To install **JustAFK**, simply drop the JustAFK.jar file into your server's plugin directory and reload! A configuration file will be automatically created which you can edit to fine-tune your own installation.

Download the JAR on the Bukkit Dev project page [located here](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/justafk/).

Features
========

Key features of **JustAFK** include: 

* Optional, automatic kicking of AFK players
* Configurable AFK time limit
* Configurable kick message
* Players are automatically hidden from others when going AFK
* Automatic detection of players returning from AFK *(e.g. when moving or chatting)*
* Set a status when going AFK


Commands
========

**/afk**: Sets yourself to away, making your player invisible and broadcasting a message to the server.
**/afk [reason]**: Sets yourself to away as above, but also includes a reason.
**/whosafk**: Shows you a list of who is currently set to away on the server.
**/setafk <player>**: (Admin only) Sets the specified player to away.
